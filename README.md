# BasicBlockchain
## Overview
This code implements a basic blockchain using python. The blockchain is made up of blocks that contain transactions, the previous block's hash, the current block's hash, and the
time it was created. Blockchain implements this in an array of blocks. The blockchain can also verify whether or not the chain was altered.

## Usage
Within the folder, there is a file titled script.py. Running the python file will create a blockchain, add transactions to it, print it's contents, alter it's contents, 
and verify that the contets were altered. This can all be seen in the terminal where the information will be outputted.
